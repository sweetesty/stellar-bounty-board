## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Our Commitment
* **Acknowledge:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** (SLA).
* **Triage:** We will provide a status update after initial triage.
* **Disclosure:** We follow a responsible disclosure timeline of **90 days** before public release, though we aim to fix critical issues much faster.

## Automated Security Analysis

This repository runs [GitHub CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) on the `javascript` language (which covers both JavaScript and TypeScript) for every push and pull request to `main`, plus a weekly scheduled scan. The workflow is defined at [.github/workflows/codeql.yml](.github/workflows/codeql.yml) and uses the `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` query suites. Alerts surface in the **Security** tab of the repository.
